                <p>This is my website named "An Escape".<br>
                    We always have many moments in our life where we want to just get rid of our current 
                    situation and we want a better life though most of the times we do envy others but 
                    there are times when everything in your life is a mess, there are problems and lots of 
                    problems whether in family, life, friend circle, loved ones, partner, etc, there are 
                    always some sort of problems and we want to escape from that situation for a while. Want
                    to take a break from everything? This is what my sites's name says...<br>
                    I do write poetries, short stories and also listen to all your problems as a good buddy.
                    I also have a blog having the same name, you can go and check out the ongoing story of a 
                    small town girl Shamya who is finding her own agenda of life.

                <p>
                    We meet people from all walks of life, sometimes we feel happier but sometimes they
                    turn put to be the sole problem of our life. So my poems express some of the feelings
                    we usually go through. Go and check out my poems in the my poems tab.<br>
                    I have also posted many such poems on the YourQuote platform.<br>
                    <a href="#">YourQuote Poems</a>

                    College life is one of the most significant phase of a teenager's life and a teenager
                    learns a lot during this phase of his/her life. So here's a not so stereotype story of
                    a teeanager girl named Shamya, do visit and comment on blogger.<br>
